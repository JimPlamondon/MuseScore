# musescore-jims: run a test binary from a scratch working directory.
#
# MuseScore's test suites (engraving_tests, iex_musicxml_tests, ...) write
# their byproducts (*.mscx, *.xml, *.png, *.json) into whatever directory they
# are launched from. Run from a repo root or a home directory and they litter
# it with hundreds of files (this happened three times during the JiMStaff
# milestones). This wrapper always runs the binary from
# <build dir>/test-cwd, which is inside the git-ignored build tree.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/run-tests.sh <test> [gtest args...]
#   BUILD_DIR=build.qt610 tools/run-tests.sh <test> [gtest args...]
#
# <test> is a binary name (engraving_tests, iex_musicxml_tests, ...) looked up
# under the build tree, or a path to a binary. BUILD_DIR is relative to the
# fork root and defaults to build.release. Test inputs are found by the
# compiled-in data roots, so the working directory does not affect them.
#
# Examples:
#   tools/run-tests.sh engraving_tests --gtest_filter='Engraving_JiMStaff*'
#   tools/run-tests.sh iex_musicxml_tests --gtest_filter='MusicXml_JiMS_Tests.*'
